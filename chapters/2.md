## Introduction

- Why do we need software to simulate metacommunity dynamics?
- Why are dynamics fundamental to ecology? They encode mechanism
- Here we provide examples in how this software can be used to
understand species interaction across space and time
- Based around four mechanisms in @Vellend2010ConSyn 

## Software Description
- Written in Julia, interfaces with data structures in EcoJulia

## What can you do with this?
- Generate sample of metacommunity trajectories based on
mechanistic hypotheses

## Case Studies


### Plant pollinator nestedness

### Food web SAR and rank abundance

### Host parasite evolution
