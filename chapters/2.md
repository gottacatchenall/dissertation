### Intro

- Why do we need software to simulate metacommunity dynamics?
- Why are dynamics fundamental to ecology? They encode mechanism
- Here we provide examples in how this software can be used to
understand species interaction across space and time


### Software Description
- Written in Julia, interfaces with data structures in EcoJulia

### What can you do with this?
- Generate distribution of metacommunity measurements based on
mechanistic hypotheses about species interaction

### Case Studies
- Plant pollinator nestedness
- Food web SAR
- Host parasite evolution
