Summary of the motivation for what I do here.

### Why is understanding metacommunities important to ecology and evolution?
- the scale at which (many) evolutionary and ecological processes intersect
- landscapes scales up to ranges [@Leibold2003MetCom]
- applied angle. landscape and climate change is causing rapid changes to the structure of Earth's landscapes and biodiversity
- Can we understand? -> Can we predict? -> Can we forecast/manage?

### Why simulate? Models and mechanisms
- Ecology is as much a study of emergent properties across scales as it is anything to do with biology.
- The data we collect from these systems is inherently noisy.
- Data we collect is information produced by a combination of "true" mechanisms + noise.
- What is an ecological mechanism? A mapping between low dimensional latent/parameter space and information space.
- If a simulation makes data the looks like real data, does it represent the "true" world?
- Does it matter? Newtonian Gravity was "right", until GR was more right.
- Mechanisms that are incorrect that produce information that shates statistical properties with
empirical data is still useful.
