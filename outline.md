## Chapter One --- Scaling up from metacommunities to ranges

## Chapter Two --- MetacommunityDynamics.jl

### Intro

- Why do we need software to simulate metacommunity dynamics?
  - Why are dynamics fundamental to ecology? The encode mechanism
- Here we provide examples in how this software can be used to
understand species interaction across space and time


### Software Description
- Written in Julia, interfaces with data structures in EcoJulia

### What can you do with this?
- Generate distribution of metacommunity measurements based on
mechanistic hypotheses about species interaction

### Case Studies
- Plant pollinator nestedness
- Food web SAR
- Host parasite evolution

## 3. Chapter Three --- Forecasting Horizon

How far into the future can we foresast the behavior of ecological
communities, given a certain accuracy of both the true dynamics and
data.

## 4. Chapter Four --- Corridor Optimization

Given a constraint, what corridor in a landscape enables ecosystem functioning?
